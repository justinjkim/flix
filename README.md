# README

This is my personal Rails project, created by following along the excellent "The Pragmatic Studio" [tutorials](https://pragmaticstudio.com/). Check it out at [powerful-citadel-75192.herokuapp.com](https://powerful-citadel-75192.herokuapp.com)!

Some technical features I learned to create this app:
* MVC architecture
* custom helper methods in the routes
* using the **through** association
* model validations
* scope queries
* variations in migration generation commands
* vanity URLS
* preset callback methods

**Note:** Please do NOT enter your actual email address if you sign up on my app, there's no special feature or email that will be sent. Please check it out as a playground of writing reviews, favoriting movies, etc. If you want more access as an admin to explore further functionality, please email me at jjkim928@gmail.com.
